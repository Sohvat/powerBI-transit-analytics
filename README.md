# Winnipeg Transit Analytics Dashboard using Power BI

## Overview
This project is an exploratory **Power BI analytics dashboard** built using publicly available **Winnipeg Transit** data. I created it as a portfolio project to demonstrate my familiarity with Power BI, including data preparation, KPI creation, and building interactive dashboards that focus on clear, meaningful insights.

Rather than trying to judge policy decisions or prove causation-type relations, the goal here is to explore **high-level usage patterns** and show how they changed around Winnipeg Transit’s recent system redesign.

## Why this project
I built this project primarily to showcase practical **analytics and power BI skills** for reporting and analytics roles. It reflects how Power BI is commonly used in real analytics settings: starting from raw data, defining useful questions, and presenting insights in a clear, interactive way.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Publicly available Winnipeg Transit data 
- **Type:** Historical transit activity records  

Exact time ranges are intentionally not emphasised, as the focus of this project is on analytical techniques and dashboard design rather than operational reporting.

## Questions the dashboard explores
The dashboard focuses on a small set of realistic, data-driven questions:

1. **Did overall transit activity change after the system redesign?**  
   A high-level comparison of total activity before and after the redesign.

2. **Did evening and weekend usage change after the redesign?**  
   This relates directly to City claims about improved off-peak service and ongoing public discussion around weekend and evening transit availability.

3. **Did the redesign reduce extremely low-activity periods (“dead zones”)?**  
   An exploratory look at whether very low-usage periods became less frequent, reflecting common rider concerns about service gaps.

4. **Did off-peak usage change more than peak usage?**  
   A comparison of changes during peak versus off-peak periods to understand where usage shifts were most noticeable.

## KPIs
To summarize the data at a glance, the dashboard includes a small set of high-level KPIs:
- Total transit records
- Average records per day
- Peak activity period
- Share of activity during evenings and weekends

---

## Tools & techniques
- **Power BI**
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation
- **DAX** for measures and KPIs
- Time-based segmentation (peak vs off-peak, weekday vs weekend)
- Interactive filters and visuals

---

## Design approach
The dashboard is designed to be simple and easy to interpret:
- A single-page layout
- KPI cards at the top for quick context
- Supporting visuals that explain trends and distributions
- Minimal assumptions, so the analysis remains robust despite route and stop changes

---

## Important note
This analysis is **exploratory**. It focuses on identifying broad patterns in the data rather than evaluating service quality or making causal claims. The results should be interpreted as descriptive trends, not definitive conclusions.
